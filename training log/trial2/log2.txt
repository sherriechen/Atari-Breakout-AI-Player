Parameters:
BATCH_SIZE = 32
GAMMA = 0.99
EPS_START = 1
EPS_END = 0.1
EPS_DECAY = 10000
TARGET_UPDATE = 1000
LEARNING_FREQ = 4
LEARNING_START = 5000
MEMORY_SIZE = 10000

Results:
Paddle frequently moves to one side then stay there.
Not good.

What to try next time:
- Clip policy_dqn parameters mananually as from:
https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/reinforcement_q_learning.html

- Update target according to "environment steps" instead of "optim steps" as from:
https://towardsdatascience.com/tutorial-double-deep-q-learning-with-dueling-network-architectures-4c1b3fb7f756

- Modify paremeters closer to DeepMind original

- Change initializer?

- Check how screenshots are used in original DeepMind
